# StickIt
This is a practice tool for percussionists wanting to work on dexterity, using exercises like G.L.Stone's Stick Control. Sticking patterns are displayed, and the user can cycle through them 'odometer' style by swiping up and down; or the pattern can be cycled rhythmically (same sequence, starting on a different beat in the pattern) by swiping side to side. Pattern length is variable.

A metronome and a timer are included as well. (Play a pattern at 96 bpm for 2 minutes...) Next steps will include a database to track a users progress through the patterns.
